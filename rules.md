## 🎴 **Higher or Lower — Game Rules**

### 🎯 **Objective**

Guess correctly whether the next card drawn from the deck will be **higher** or **lower** than the current card. Try to get the longest streak of correct guesses!

---

### 🧩 **Setup**

* Use **one standard 52-card deck**.
* Jokers will reset your streak.
* Shuffle the deck thoroughly.
* Deal **one card face-up** in the center — this is the **starting card**.

---

### 🔢 **Card Rankings**

Cards rank from **low to high** as follows:
**Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King.**
(Aces are always **low**, unless you decide otherwise before starting the game.)

Suits (♠, ♥, ♦, ♣) do **not** affect rank.

### 🕹️ **How to Play**

1. The **dealer** shows the top card of the deck (the starting card).
2. The **player guesses** whether the next card will be **higher** or **lower**.
3. The dealer flips the next card face-up:

   * If the player guessed **correctly**, they score a point (or continue their streak).
   * If they guessed **wrong**, their streak returns to 0.
4. The new card becomes the **current card** for the next round.
5. Continue until:

   * 10 rounds have passed, **or**
   * The deck runs out (for full-deck play).

### ⚖️ **Special Rules**

* **Equal cards:** If the next card is the *same rank* (e.g., two 7s), that counts as **incorrect** (or a “push,” depending on your house rule).
  Choose before the game starts which applies.
* **Ace flexibility:** You can agree before play whether Ace is **always low** after a Jack, Queen and King and **always high** after a number (e.g., after a King, Ace is lower; after 2, Ace is higher).

### 🧮 **Scoring Options**

Choose one style:

1. **Streak Play:** Count how many guesses in a row a player gets right. Longest streak wins.
2. **Points Play:** 1 point per correct guess; most points after full deck wins.
3. **Survival Play:** Each player starts with 3 lives; lose one for each wrong guess — last player standing wins.

---

### 👥 **Multiplayer Variation**

* Player and CPU take turns guessing.
* Each player starts with the same number of lives or takes turns per round.
* Optional: add **bonus points** for guessing correctly several times in a row.
