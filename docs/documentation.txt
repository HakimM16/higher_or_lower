Higher or Lower: documentation Notes
===================================

1. Folder Layout
----------------
- `src/` keeps all executable Python code so imports stay consistent and packaging later is easier.
- Within `src/`, the `game_features/` package (games modules) isolates gameplay logic (`dealer.py`, `deck.py`, `card.py`, `player.py`, `cpu.py`, `game.py`). This separation lets us extend or swap pieces (e.g., new AI opponents) without touching the entry point.
- `docs/` holds supporting documentation (this file, `rules.md`). Keeping docs with the project ensures a single source of truth.
- `tests/` gathers unit tests, mirroring the `src/` structure so test coverage can grow without cluttering runtime code.

2. `main.py` Responsibilities
-----------------------------
- `src/main.py` exposes a tiny interface that simply imports `show_menu()` from the gameplay package and triggers it under `if __name__ == "__main__"`. This keeps the entry point obvious for humans and tooling (debuggers, packaging entry points).
- With the `Game` menu isolated inside `game.py`, we avoid circular imports and make it possible to run CLI utilities or tests without invoking interactive prompts.

3. Other Supporting Choices
---------------------------
- `rules.md` lives in `docs/` so both players and the CLI can read the same markdown file (`Game.show_rules()` references it via `pathlib`, maintaining one canonical rule set).
- `Game` purposely keeps all round flow (`play_round`, `_handle_result`, `_joker_triggered`) in one class so state (current card, scores, rounds) is centralized. Commands from `main.py` instantiate `Dealer` with the chosen round count and hand control to `Game.start_game()`, which in turn loops over `play_round()` until exhausted.
- `Player` and `CPU` both expose common operations (`make_guess`, `increment_score`, `reset_score`, `get_score`). This shared interface keeps `Game` agnostic to who is playing, so adding multiplayer or additional bots would require minimal wiring.
- `Dealer` encapsulates deck management and card comparison logic. By letting `Dealer` evaluate guesses and update the current card, we avoid duplicating card-order rules in multiple modules and make it easier to swap in future rule variants (e.g., Ace high vs. low).

Ideas for Future Improvement
----------------------------
1. Parameterise card decks (e.g., Jokers, multiple decks) to support different difficulty modes.
2. Add different styles of play such as streak play or survival play
3. Implement a Restart/Replay Option: Let players easily restart or play again.
4. Add More Card Logic: Include jokers, special cards, or combos for more depth.
5. Add Animations or Card Graphics: Use Unicode symbols or ASCII art for cards, or add graphical cards in a GUI.
